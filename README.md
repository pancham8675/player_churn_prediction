## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or above).
3. Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook `PlayerChurnForecasting.ipynb` to run the code.
5. To view the Power BI dashboard, download and open the `player_churn_powerbi_dashboard.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop.

## Usage
- Run the Jupyter Notebook to process the data and build predictive models.
- Open the Power BI dashboard to visualize player churn metrics and insights.
- Utilize the findings from the research paper for further analysis or academic purposes.

## Project Structure
- **`dataset.csv`**: Raw dataset containing player metrics.
- **`final_dataset.csv`**: Processed dataset after feature engineering and cleaning.
- **`PlayerChurnForecasting.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow from data processing to model building.
- **`player_churn_powerbi_dashboard.pbix`**: Power BI file with visualizations of player churn metrics.
- **`Research Paper.pdf`**: Published research paper detailing the methodologies and findings of the project.

## Features
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizing machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and Logistic Regression to predict player churn.
- **Data Processing**: Feature engineering and data cleaning techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Power BI dashboard providing a clear visual representation of churn metrics and insights.

## Files in the Repository
- **`dataset.csv`**: The raw data used for the project.
- **`final_dataset.csv`**: Cleaned and processed data ready for modeling.
- **`PlayerChurnForecasting.ipynb`**: The main code file containing the data analysis, modeling, and prediction steps.
- **`player_churn_powerbi_dashboard.pbix`**: The Power BI dashboard file to visualize and analyze the results.

## Data
- The **`dataset.csv`** contains raw player data, including metrics such as session duration, in-game purchases, and player demographics.
- The **`final_dataset.csv`** includes the processed data with engineered features ready for model training.

## Models
- **Random Forest**: Used for predicting player churn with high accuracy.
- **Logistic Regression**: Applied as a baseline model for churn prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
- The models provided strong predictive performance, with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy.
- Key findings from the analysis revealed that certain player behaviors and demographics significantly impact churn likelihood.

## Visualizations
- **Power BI Dashboard**: The dashboard visualizes player churn metrics, allowing for easy interpretation of the data.
