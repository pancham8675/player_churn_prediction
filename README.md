## Project Workflow

The workflow of the Player Churn Prediction project is as follows:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - The initial raw data was collected from various gaming platforms, capturing key player metrics and behaviors.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - **Loading Data:**
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     raw_data = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
     ```
   - **Data Cleaning:**
     - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize data types.
     ```python
     cleaned_data = raw_data.dropna().drop_duplicates()
     ```
   - **Feature Engineering:**
     - Create new features that enhance the predictive power of the dataset.
     ```python
     cleaned_data['session_duration_log'] = np.log(cleaned_data['session_duration'] + 1)
     ```
   - **Splitting Data:**
     - Split the data into training and testing datasets.
     ```python
     from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
     X = cleaned_data.drop('churn', axis=1)
     y = cleaned_data['churn']
     X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
     ```

3. **Model Building:**
   - **Model Selection:**
     - Choose appropriate machine learning models for prediction.
     - Here, Random Forest and Logistic Regression were selected.
   - **Model Training:**
     ```python
     from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
     rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
     rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
     ```
   - **Model Evaluation:**
     - Evaluate the model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
     ```python
     from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
     y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)
     print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
     print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
     ```

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - **Power BI Dashboard:**
     - Use Power BI to visualize key metrics and player churn insights.
     - Load the `final_dataset.csv` into Power BI and create visuals.
   - **Dashboard Integration:**
     - The dashboard integrates insights from the predictive model and highlights areas for improving player retention.

5. **Documentation:**
     - The findings, methodology, and results were documented in a research paper, which was published and added to the repository.
     - The paper provides detailed analysis and insights derived from the project, offering valuable contributions to the field.

## Features
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizing machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and Logistic Regression to predict player churn.
- **Data Processing**: Feature engineering and data cleaning techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Power BI dashboard providing a clear visual representation of churn metrics and insights.

## Files in the Repository
- **`dataset.csv`**: The raw data used for the project.
- **`final_dataset.csv`**: Cleaned and processed data ready for modeling.
- **`PlayerChurnForecasting.ipynb`**: The main code file containing the data analysis, modeling, and prediction steps.
- **`player_churn_powerbi_dashboard.pbix`**: The Power BI dashboard file to visualize and analyze the results.
